# Bank_Churn
### üè¶ Bank Churn Prediction Project This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn in the banking industry.  
### üìä Project Overview
- Using a real-world dataset of bank customers, the project explores relationships between customer attributes (e.g., age, tenure, balance, number of products, credit score) and their likelihood of churning. The steps include:

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key features and their correlation with churn.

- Model Training: Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

- Model Evaluation: Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to assess performance.

- Model Interpretation: Analyzed feature importance and used SHAP values to explain predictions.

### üîç Key Highlights
- Data Source: The project uses a real-world dataset containing customer information including age, tenure, account balance, number of products, credit score, and more.

- Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and balancing the dataset.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed to understand trends and uncover patterns related to churn.

- Machine Learning Models: Trained and evaluated models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC were used to assess model performance.

- Interpretability: Feature importance and SHAP values were used to explain model predictions.

- Deployment Ready: The model can be deployed via a Flask API or Streamlit app for real-time churn prediction.

### üéØ Outcome
The project demonstrates how banks can make data-driven decisions to reduce customer attrition and improve loyalty through intelligent analysis.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies
- Python, pandas, NumPy

- scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP

- Matplotlib, seaborn

- Jupyter Notebook

### üéØ Outcome
- This project demonstrates how predictive modeling can support strategic decision-making in customer retention. It provides a framework for banks to use customer data to identify churn risks and take action before losing valuable clients.
